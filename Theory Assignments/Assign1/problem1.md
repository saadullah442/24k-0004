# Description
Get Speed as input
Input will be float
Multiply speed with 1.61 to convert mile to km
Divide the converted distance by 3600 to get speed in km per second

# Pseudocode
Declare Speed, Convdis, Convtime , ConvSpeed As Float
Input Speed
Convdis = Speed * 1.61
Convtime = 1 * 3600
ConvSpeed = Convdis / Convtime
